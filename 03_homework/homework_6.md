**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

As a pediatric/NICU pharmacist, my role is crucial in managing medication therapies for our most vulnerable patientsâ€”newborns and children. This involves ensuring the safe and effective use of medications, collaborating with allied healthcare professionals to optimize patient outcomes, and providing medication counseling to parents. Given the delicate nature of pediatric and neonatal care, integrating robust ethical practices and addressing healthcare inequities are essential.

To enhance the ethical component of my work, I can advocate for transparent communication with parents, providing comprehensive information about medications, potential side effects, and treatment options. This empowers parents to make informed decisions about their child's care. Upholding patient confidentiality and obtaining informed consent are fundamental ethical principles that must be rigorously maintained. Engaging in regular ethical discussions with colleagues can also foster a culture of ethical awareness and mutual support within the healthcare team.

Addressing inequities involves recognizing and actively working to mitigate disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. This can be achieved by identifying barriers that patients from marginalized communities may face, such as financial constraints, language barriers, or lack of transportation. Implementing strategies like providing multilingual resources, collaborating with social services to assist with medication costs, and advocating for policy changes that promote equitable access to healthcare are crucial steps. Additionally, participating in community outreach programs and supporting initiatives that aim to improve healthcare access for underserved populations can extend the impact of these efforts beyond the hospital setting.
